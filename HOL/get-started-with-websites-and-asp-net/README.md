# Getting started with Azure App Service Web Apps and ASP.NET

This lab shows how to create an ASP.NET web application and deploy it to an Azure App Service Web App by using Visual Studio 2015 Preview. It assumes that you have no prior experience using Azure or ASP.NET. On completing the lab, you will have a simple web application up and running in the cloud.

This lab includes the following sections:

1. [Create an ASP.NET web application in Visual Studio](#create-an-aspnet-web-application)
1. [Create a SQL Database online](#create-a-sql-database-online)
1. [Deploy the application to Azure](#deploy-the-application-to-azure)
1. [Make a change and redeploy](#make-a-change-and-redeploy)
1. [Monitor and manage the site in the portal](#monitor-and-manage-the-site-in-the-management-portal)
1. [Appendix - Cleanup](#cleanup)

## Create an ASP.NET web application

In this task you will create the web application that is going to be used throughout this lab.

## Create a SQL Database online

1. In your browser, go to [http://portal.azure.com](http://portal.azure.com), and sign in with your Azure credentials.

	On the left, click on **NEW** and **Data + Storage** and followed by **SQL Database** in the Data Storage section which is a database as a service.

2. Fill the details in **SQL Database** section.

	![Database App details](./images/create-sql-database.png)

    _Database details_
	
3. Create a new **Server**(if you dont have an existing server) along with the Server Credentials, and select the **Source** as **Blank**, **Pricing Tier**, **Optional Configuration**, and select the existing **Resource Group** where we previously created App Service and Click **Create**

	![Database App details](./images/create-database-server.png)

    _Create Database details_

4. Once the SQL Database is created. Click on the SQL Databases at left pane. and select the database which we created just now.

	![Database details](./images/database-created.png)

    _Created Database details_
	
5. Copy the **Connection String** from the Azure portal which will be used when we deploy the App Server as we have to point the Connection String to this database.

	![Database details](./images/database-string.png)

    _Created Database details_
	
## Deploy the application to Azure

1. In the **Azure App Service Activity** window, click **Publish ContactManager to this Web App now**.

	![Web App created](./images/create-appservice-webapp-high.png)

    _Azure App Service Activity Window_

	In a few seconds the **Publish Web** wizard appears.

	The settings that Visual Studio needs to deploy your project to Azure have been saved in a *publish profile*. The wizard enables you to review and change those settings.

2. In the **Connection** tab of the **Publish Web** wizard, click **Validate Connection** to make sure that Visual Studio can connect to Azure in order to deploy the web project.

	![Validate connection](./images/publish-azure-connections.png)

    _Validating the connection_

	When the connection has been validated, a green check mark is shown next to the **Validate Connection** button.

3. Click **Next**.

	![Successfully validated connection](./images/publish-validate.png)

	_Successfully validated connection_

4. The **Settings** tab is shown. If you expand **File Publish Options** you will see several settings that enable you to handle scenarios that don't apply to this lab:

	* **Remove additional files at destination**.

		Deletes any files at the server that aren't in your project. You might need this if you were deploying a project to a site that you had deployed a different project to earlier.

	* **Precompile during publishing**.

		Can reduce first-request warm up times for large sites.

	* **Exclude files from the App_Data folder**.

		For testing you sometimes have a SQL Server database file in App_Data which you don't want to deploy to production.

	In this case, keep the default values for **Configuration** and **File Publish Options** and click **Next**.

	![Settings tab](./images/publish-azure-connection-string.png)

    _Settings tab_

5. In the **Preview** tab, click **Start Preview**.

	![StartPreview button in the Preview tab](./images/start-preview.png)

	_Start Preview button - Preview tab_

	The tab displays a list of the files that will be copied to the server. Displaying the preview isn't required to publish the application but it's a useful function to be aware of.

6. Click **Publish**.

	![StartPreview file output](./images/click-publish.png)

	_File Preview_

	Visual Studio begins the process of copying the files to the Azure server.

	The **Output** and **Azure App Service Activity** windows show what deployment actions were taken and report successful completion of the deployment.

	![Azure App Service Activity](./images/publish-output.png)

    _Azure App Service Activity reporting successful deployment_

	![Output window](./images/output-window.png)

	  _Output Window reporting successful deployment_

	Upon successful deployment, the default browser automatically opens to the URL of the deployed Web App, and the application that you created is now running in the cloud. The URL in the browser address bar shows that the site is being loaded from the Internet.

	![Web App running in Azure](./images/publish-success.png)

	_Web App running in Azure_

7. Close the browser.

## Make a change and redeploy

In this task, you will change the **h1** heading of the home page, run the project and redeploy on your App Service on Azure.

1. Open the *Views/Home/Index.cshtml* file in **Solution Explorer**, change the **h1** heading from "ASP.NET" to "ASP.NET and Azure", and save the file.

	![MVC index.cshtml](./images/solution-explorer-index.png)

    _Index.cshtml_

	![MVC h1 change](./images/index-modification.png)

    _Changing the page's heading_

2. Press **CTRL+F5** to see the updated heading by running the site.

	The **http://localhost** URL shows that it's running on your local computer. By default it's running in IIS Express, which is a lightweight version of IIS designed for use during web application development.

3. Close the browser.

4. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the project, and choose **Publish**.

	![Chooose Publish](./images/publish-aspnet.png)

    _Preparing a new deployment_

	The Preview tab of the **Publish Web** wizard appears. If you needed to change any publish settings you could choose a different tab, but now all you want to do is redeploy with the same settings.

5. In the **Publish Web** wizard, click **Publish**.

	![Click Publish](./images/azure-publish-change-files.png)

	_Publish Web Wizard_

	Visual Studio deploys the project to Azure and opens the site in the default browser.

	![Changed site deployed](./images/publish-azure-modified.png)

	_Changes deployed_

## Monitor and manage the site in the Azure portal

The [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) is a web interface that enables you to manage and monitor your Azure services, such as the App Service Web App you just created. In this task you will look at some of what you can do in the portal.

1. In your browser, go to [http://portal.azure.com](http://portal.azure.com), and sign in with your Azure credentials.

	On the left, click on **App Services** and the Web App Services are listed.

2. Click the name of your Web App on the blade.

3. This blade gives you an overview of your Web App.

	You can access monitoring information, change the pricing tier, configure continuous deployment and various other tasks.

	![Web App overview blade](./images/web-app-overview-blade.png)

  	_Web App's overview blade_

	At this point your site hasn't had much traffic and may not show anything in the graph. If you browse to your application, refresh the page a few times, and then come back again, it will show up some traffic.

4. Click at **Settings** at the top of the blade. Then click **Application Settings**.

	The [Application Settings](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/web-sites-configure/) blade enables you to control the .NET version used for the Web App, enable features such as [WebSockets](http://azure.microsoft.com/blog/2013/11/14/introduction-to-websockets-on-windows-azure-web-sites/) and [diagnostic logging](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/web-sites-enable-diagnostic-log/), set [connection string values](http://azure.microsoft.com/blog/2013/07/17/windows-azure-web-sites-how-application-strings-and-connection-strings-work/), and more.
