# Visualize your cluster with Service Fabric Explorer

Service Fabric Explorer is a web-based tool for inspecting and managing applications and nodes in an Azure Service Fabric cluster. Service Fabric Explorer is hosted directly within the cluster, so it is always available, regardless of where your cluster is running.

## Connect to Service Fabric Explorer

If you have followed the instructions to [prepare your development environment](service-fabric-get-started.md), you can launch Service Fabric Explorer on your local cluster by navigating to http://localhost:19080/Explorer.

>[AZURE.NOTE] If you are using Internet Explorer with Service Fabric Explorer to manage a remote cluster, you need to configure some Internet Explorer settings. Go to **Tools** > **Compatibility View Settings** and uncheck **Display intranet sites in Compatibility View** to ensure that all information loads correctly.

## Understand the Service Fabric Explorer layout

You can navigate through Service Fabric Explorer by using the tree on the left. At the root of the tree, the cluster dashboard provides an overview of your cluster, including a summary of application and node health.

![Service Fabric Explorer cluster dashboard][sfx-cluster-dashboard]

### View the cluster's layout

Nodes in a Service Fabric cluster are placed across a two-dimensional grid of fault domains and upgrade domains. This placement ensures that your applications remain available in the presence of hardware failures and application upgrades. You can view how the current cluster is laid out by using the cluster map.

![Service Fabric Explorer cluster map][sfx-cluster-map]

### View applications and services

The cluster contains two subtrees: one for applications and another for nodes.

You can use the application view to navigate through Service Fabric's logical hierarchy: applications, services, partitions, and replicas.

In the example below, the application **MyApp** consists of two services, **MyStatefulService** and **WebService**. Since **MyStatefulService** is stateful, it includes a partition with one primary and two secondary replicas. By contrast, WebSvcService is stateless and contains a single instance.

![Service Fabric Explorer application view][sfx-application-tree]

At each level of the tree, the main pane shows pertinent information about the item. For example, you can see the health status and version for a particular service.

### View the cluster's nodes

The node view shows the physical layout of the cluster. For a given node, you can inspect which applications have code deployed on that node. More specifically, you can see which replicas are currently running there.

## Actions

Service Fabric Explorer offers a quick way to invoke actions on nodes, applications, and services within your cluster.

For example, to delete an application instance, simply choose the application from the tree on the left, and then choose **Actions** > **Delete Application**.

![Deleting an application in Service Fabric Explorer][sfx-delete-application]

>[AZURE.TIP] The same actions can be performed from the tree view by clicking on the ellipsis next to each element.

The following table lists the actions available for each entity:

| **Entity** | **Action** | **Description** |
| ------ | ------ | ----------- |
| Application type | Unprovision type | Removes the application package from the cluster's image store. Requires all applications of that type to be removed first. |
| Application | Delete Application | Delete the application, including all of its services and their state (if any).  |
| Service | Delete Service | Delete the service and its state (if any). |
| Node | Activate | Activate the node. |
|| Deactivate (pause) | Pause the node in its current state. Services will continue to run but Service Fabric will not proactively move anything onto or off of it unless it is required to prevent an outage or data inconsistency. This action is typically used to enable debugging services on a specific node to ensure that they do not move during inspection. |
|| Deactivate (restart) | Safely move all in-memory services off of a node and close persistent services. Typically used when the host processes or machine need to be restarted. |
|| Deactivate (remove data) | Safely close all services running on the node after building sufficient spare replicas. Typically used when a node (or at least its storage) is being permanently taken out of commission. |
|| Remove node state | Remove knowledge of a node's replicas from the cluster. Typically used when an already failed node is deemed unrecoverable. |

Since many actions are destructive, you may be asked to confirm your intent before the action is completed.

>[AZURE.TIP] Every action that can be performed through Service Fabric Explorer can also be performed through PowerShell or a REST API, to enable automation.



## Connect to a remote Service Fabric cluster

Since Service Fabric Explorer is web-based and runs within the cluster, it is accessible from any browser, as long as you know the cluster's endpoint and have sufficient permissions to access it.

### Discover the Service Fabric Explorer endpoint for a remote cluster

In order to reach Service Fabric Explorer for a given cluster, simply point your browser to:

http://&lt;your-cluster-endpoint&gt;:19080/Explorer

The full URL is also available in the cluster essentials pane of the Azure portal.

### Connect to a secure cluster

You can control access to your Service Fabric cluster by requiring clients to present a certificate in order to connect to it.

If you attempt to connect to Service Fabric Explorer on a secure cluster, your browser will ask you to present a certificate in order to gain access.
