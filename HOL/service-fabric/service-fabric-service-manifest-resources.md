# Specify resources in a service manifest

## Overview

The service manifest allows resources that are used by the service to be declared/changed without changing the compiled code. Azure Service Fabric supports configuration of endpoint resources for the service. The access to the resources that are specified in the service manifest can be controlled via the SecurityGroup in the application manifest. The declaration of resources allows these resources to be changed at deployment time, meaning the service doesn't need to introduce a new configuration mechanism.

## Endpoints

When an endpoint resource is defined in the service manifest, Service Fabric assigns ports from the reserved application port range if an explicit port isn't specified (e.g., look at the endpoint *ServiceEndpoint1* below). Additionally, services can also request a specific port in a resource. Service replicas running on different cluster nodes can be assigned different port numbers, while replicas of the same service running on the same node share the same port. Such ports can be used by the service replicas for various purposes such as replication, listening for client requests, etc.

```xml
<Resources>
  <Endpoints>
    <Endpoint Name="ServiceEndpoint1" Protocol="http"/>
    <Endpoint Name="ServiceEndpoint2" Protocol="http" Port="80"/>
    <Endpoint Name="ServiceEndpoint3" Protocol="https"/>
  </Endpoints>
</Resources>
```

Refer to [Configuring stateful Reliable Services](service-fabric-reliable-services-configuration.md) to read more about referencing endpoints from the config package settings file (settings.xml).

## Example: specifying an HTTP endpoint for your service

The following service manifest defines one TCP endpoint resource and two HTTP endpoint resources in the &lt;Resources&gt; element.

HTTP endpoints are automatically ACL'd by Service Fabric.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<ServiceManifest Name="Stateful1Pkg"
                 Version="1.0.0"
                 xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2011/01/fabric"
                 xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"
                 xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
  <ServiceTypes>
    <!-- This is the name of your ServiceType.
         This name must match the string used in the RegisterServiceType call in Program.cs. -->
    <StatefulServiceType ServiceTypeName="Stateful1Type" HasPersistedState="true" />
  </ServiceTypes>

  <!-- Code package is your service executable. -->
  <CodePackage Name="Code" Version="1.0.0">
    <EntryPoint>
      <ExeHost>
        <Program>Stateful1.exe</Program>
      </ExeHost>
    </EntryPoint>
  </CodePackage>

  <!-- Config package is the contents of the Config directoy under PackageRoot that contains an
       independently updateable and versioned set of custom configuration settings for your service. -->
  <ConfigPackage Name="Config" Version="1.0.0" />

  <Resources>
    <Endpoints>
      <!-- This endpoint is used by the communication listener to obtain the port number on which to
           listen. Note that if your service is partitioned, this port is shared with
           replicas of different partitions that are placed in your code. -->
      <Endpoint Name="ServiceEndpoint1" Protocol="http"/>
      <Endpoint Name="ServiceEndpoint2" Protocol="http" Port="80"/>
      <Endpoint Name="ServiceEndpoint3" Protocol="https"/>

      <!-- This endpoint is used by the replicator for replicating the state of your service.
           This endpoint is configured through the ReplicatorSettings config section in the Settings.xml
           file under the ConfigPackage. -->
      <Endpoint Name="ReplicatorEndpoint" />
    </Endpoints>
  </Resources>
</ServiceManifest>
```

## Example: specifying an HTTPS endpoint for your service

The HTTPS protocol provides server authentication and is also used for encrypting client-server communication. To enable this on your Service Fabric service, when you're defining the service, specify the protocol in the *Resources -> Endpoints -> Endpoint* section of the service manifest, as shown earlier for the endpoint *ServiceEndpoint3*.

>[AZURE.NOTE] A serviceâ€™s protocol cannot be changed during application upgrade, since this would be a breaking change.


Here is an example ApplicationManifest that you need to set for HTTPS. (You will need to provide the thumbprint for your certificate.) The EndpointRef is a reference to EndpointResource in ServiceManifest, for which you set the HTTPS protocol. You can add more than one Endpointcertificate.  

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<ApplicationManifest ApplicationTypeName="Application1Type"
                     ApplicationTypeVersion="1.0.0"
                     xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2011/01/fabric"
                     xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"
                     xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
  <Parameters>
    <Parameter Name="Stateful1_MinReplicaSetSize" DefaultValue="2" />
    <Parameter Name="Stateful1_PartitionCount" DefaultValue="1" />
    <Parameter Name="Stateful1_TargetReplicaSetSize" DefaultValue="3" />
  </Parameters>
  <!-- Import the ServiceManifest from the ServicePackage. The ServiceManifestName and ServiceManifestVersion
       should match the Name and Version attributes of the ServiceManifest element defined in the
       ServiceManifest.xml file. -->
  <ServiceManifestImport>
    <ServiceManifestRef ServiceManifestName="Stateful1Pkg" ServiceManifestVersion="1.0.0" />
    <ConfigOverrides />
    <Policies>
      <EndpointBindingPolicy CertificateRef="TestCert1" EndpointRef="ServiceEndpoint3"/>
    </Policies>
  </ServiceManifestImport>
  <DefaultServices>
    <!-- The section below creates instances of service types when an instance of this
         application type is created. You can also create one or more instances of service type by using the
         Service Fabric PowerShell module.

         The attribute ServiceTypeName below must match the name defined in the imported ServiceManifest.xml file. -->
    <Service Name="Stateful1">
      <StatefulService ServiceTypeName="Stateful1Type" TargetReplicaSetSize="[Stateful1_TargetReplicaSetSize]" MinReplicaSetSize="[Stateful1_MinReplicaSetSize]">
        <UniformInt64Partition PartitionCount="[Stateful1_PartitionCount]" LowKey="-9223372036854775808" HighKey="9223372036854775807" />
      </StatefulService>
    </Service>
  </DefaultServices>
  <Certificates>
    <EndpointCertificate Name="TestCert1" X509FindValue="FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF F0" X509StoreName="MY" />  
  </Certificates>
</ApplicationManifest>
```
