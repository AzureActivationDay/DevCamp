# Service Fabric application upgrade using PowerShell

The most frequently used and recommended upgrade approach is the monitored rolling upgrade.  Azure Service Fabric monitors the health of the application being upgraded based on a set of health policies. When the applications in an update domain (UD) have been upgraded, Service Fabric evaluates the application health and determines whether to proceed to the next update domain or fail the upgrade based on the health policies.

A monitored application upgrade can be performed using the managed or native APIs, PowerShell, or REST. For instructions on performing an upgrade using Visual Studio, please see [Upgrading your application using Visual Studio](service-fabric-application-upgrade-tutorial.md).

With Service Fabric monitored rolling upgrades, the application administrator can configure the health evaluation policy that Service Fabric uses to determine if the application is healthy. In addition, the administrator can configure the action to be taken when the health evaluation fails (for example, doing an automatic rollback.) This section walks through a monitored upgrade for one of the SDK samples that uses PowerShell.

## Step 1: Build and deploy the Visual Objects sample

These steps can be done by downloading the application from GitHub, and adding the **webgl-utils.js** and **gl-matrix-min.js** files into the project as mentioned in the sample's readme file. Without that, the application will not work.

After adding these to the project, build and publish the application by right clicking on the application project, **VisualObjectsApplication,** and selecting the **Publish** command in the Service Fabric menu item as follows.  See [Service Fabric application upgrade tutorial](service-fabric-application-upgrade-tutorial.md) for more information.  Alternatively, you can use PowerShell to deploy your application.

> [AZURE.NOTE] Before any of the Service Fabric commands may be used in PowerShell, you first need to connect to the cluster by using the `Connect-ServiceFabricCluster` cmdlet. Similarly, it is assumed that the Cluster has already been set up on your local machine. See the article on [setting up your Service Fabric development environment](service-fabric-get-started.md).

After building the project in Visual Studio, you can use the PowerShell command **Copy-ServiceFabricApplicationPackage** to copy the application package to the ImageStore. This step is followed by registering the application to the Service Fabric runtime by using the **Register-ServiceFabricApplicationPackage** cmdlet. The final step is starting an instance of the application by using the **New-ServiceFabricApplication** cmdlet.  These three steps are analogous to using the **Deploy** menu item in Visual Studio.

Now, you can use [Service Fabric Explorer to view the cluster and the application](service-fabric-visualizing-your-cluster.md). The application has a web service that can be navigated to in Internet Explorer by typing [http://localhost:8081/visualobjects](http://localhost:8081/visualobjects) in the address bar.  You should see some floating visual objects moving around in the screen.  Additionally, you can use **Get-ServiceFabricApplication** to check the application status.

## Step 2: Update the Visual Objects sample

You might notice that with the version that was deployed in Step 1, the visual objects do not rotate. Let's upgrade this application to one where the visual objects also rotate.

Select the VisualObjects.ActorService project within the VisualObjects solution, and open the StatefulVisualObjectActor.cs file. Within that file, navigate to the method `MoveObject`, comment out `this.State.Move()`, and uncomment `this.State.Move(true)`. This change will make the objects rotate after the service is upgraded.

We also need to update the *ServiceManifest.xml* file (under PackageRoot) of the project **VisualObjects.ActorService**. Update the *CodePackage* and the service version to 2.0, and the corresponding lines in the *ServiceManifest.xml* file.
You can use the Visual Studio *Edit Manifest Files* option after you right-click on the solution to make the manifest file changes.


After the changes are made, the manifest should look like the following (highlighted portions show the changes):

```xml
<ServiceManifestName="VisualObjects.ActorService" Version="2.0" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2011/01/fabric" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">

<CodePackageName="Code" Version="2.0">
```

Now we need to update the *ApplicationManifest.xml* file (found under the **VisualObjects** project under the **VisualObjects** solution) to use version 2.0 of the **VisualObjects.ActorService** project, and also update the Application version to 2.0.0.0 from 1.0.0.0. Now the corresponding lines in the *ApplicationManifest.xml* should read like the following:

```xml
<ApplicationManifestxmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" ApplicationTypeName="VisualObjects" ApplicationTypeVersion="2.0.0.0" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2011/01/fabric">

 <ServiceManifestRefServiceManifestName="VisualObjects.ActorService" ServiceManifestVersion="2.0" />
```


Now, build the project by selecting just the **ActorService** project, and then right-clicking and selecting **Build** in Visual Studio. (If you select **Rebuild all**, you might have to update the versions for the other projects as well, in its *ServiceManifest.xml* and in the *ApplicationManifest.xml*, since the code would have changed). Next, let's package the updated application by right-clicking on ***VisualObjectsApplication***, selecting the Service Fabric Menu, and choosing **Package**. This should create an application package that can be deployed.  Your updated application is ready to be deployed now.


## Step 3:  Decide on health policies and upgrade parameters

Please familiarize yourself with the [application upgrade parameters](service-fabric-application-upgrade-parameters.md) and the [upgrade process](service-fabric-application-upgrade.md) to get a good understanding of the various upgrade parameters, time-outs, and health criterion applied. For this walkthrough, we will leave the service health evaluation criterion to be the default (and recommended) values, which means that all services and instances should be _healthy_ after the upgrade.  

However, let's increase the *HealthCheckStableDuration* to 60 seconds (so that the services will be healthy for at least 20 seconds before the upgrade proceeds to the next update domain).  Let's also set the *UpgradeDomainTimeout* to be 1200 seconds and the *UpgradeTimeout* to be 3000 seconds.

Finally, let's also set the *UpgradeFailureAction* to rollback, thereby requesting that Service Fabric roll back the application to the previous version if it encounters any issues during upgrade. Thus, the upgrade parameters we'll specify when starting the upgrade (in Step 4) will be the following:

FailureAction = Rollback

HealthCheckStableDurationSec = 60

UpgradeDomainTimeoutSec = 1200

UpgradeTimeout = 3000


## Step 4: Prepare application for upgrade

Now the application is built and ready to be upgraded. If you open up a PowerShell window as an administrator and type **Get-ServiceFabricApplication**, it should let you know that it is application type 1.0.0.0 of **VisualObjects** that's been deployed.  

The application package is stored under the following relative path where you uncompressed the Service Fabric SDK - *Samples\Services\Stateful\VisualObjects\VisualObjects\obj\x64\Debug*. You should find a "Package" folder in that directory; this is where the application package is stored. Please check the timestamps to ensure that it is the latest build (you may need to modify the paths appropriately as well).

Now let's copy the updated application package to the Service Fabric ImageStore (where the application packages are stored by Service Fabric). The parameter *ApplicationPackagePathInImageStore* informs Service Fabric where it can find the application package. We have put the updated application in "VisualObjects\_V2" with the following command (you may need to modify paths again appropriately).

```powershell
Copy-ServiceFabricApplicationPackage  -ApplicationPackagePath .\Samples\Services\Stateful\VisualObjects\VisualObjects\obj\x64\Debug\Package
-ImageStoreConnectionString fabric:ImageStore   -ApplicationPackagePathInImageStore "VisualObjects\_V2"
```

The next step is to register this application with Service Fabric, which can be performed using the following command:

```powershell
Register-ServiceFabricApplicationType -ApplicationPathInImageStore "VisualObjects\_V2"
```

If the above command doesn't succeed, it is likely that you need a rebuild of all services. As mentioned in Step 2, you may have to update your WebService version as well.

## Step 5: Start the application upgrade

Now, we're all set to start the application upgrade by using the following command:

```powershell
Start-ServiceFabricApplicationUpgrade -ApplicationName fabric:/VisualObjects -ApplicationTypeVersion 2.0.0.0 -HealthCheckStableDurationSec 60 -UpgradeDomainTimeoutSec 1200 -UpgradeTimeout 3000   -FailureAction Rollback -Monitored
```


Note that the application name is the same as it was described in the *ApplicationManifest.xml* file. Service Fabric uses this name to identify which application is getting upgraded. If you set the time-outs to be too short, you may encounter a failure message that states the problem. Refer to the troubleshooting section, or increase the time-outs.

Now, as the application upgrade proceeds, you can monitor it using Service Fabric Explorer, or by using the following PowerShell command: **Get-ServiceFabricApplicationUpgrade fabric:/VisualObjects**.

In a few minutes, the status that you got by using the PowerShell command above, should state that all update domains were upgraded (completed). And you should find that the visual objects in your browser window will now have started rotating!

You may want to try changing the versions and moving from version 2 to version 3 as an exercise, or even from version 2 back to version 1 (yes, you can upgrade from v2 to v1). Play with time-outs and health policies to make yourself familiar with them. When you are deploying to an Azure cluster, the parameters used will be different than those used when deploying to a local cluster, so it's a good idea to set the time-outs conservatively.
