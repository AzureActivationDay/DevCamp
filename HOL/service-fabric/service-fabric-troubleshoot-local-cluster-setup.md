# Troubleshoot your local development cluster setup

If you run into an issue while interacting with your local Azure Service Fabric development cluster, review the following suggestions for potential solutions.

## Cluster setup failures

### Cannot clean up Service Fabric logs

#### Problem

While running the DevClusterSetup script, you see an error like this:

    Cannot clean up C:\SfDevCluster\Log fully as references are likely being held to items in it. Please remove those and run this script again.
    At line:1 char:1 + .\DevClusterSetup.ps1
    + ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    + CategoryInfo : NotSpecified: (:) [Write-Error], WriteErrorException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.WriteErrorException,DevClusterSetup.ps1


#### Solution

Close the current PowerShell window and open a new PowerShell window as an administrator. You should now be able to successfully run the script.

## Cluster connection failures

### Service Fabric PowerShell cmdlets are not recognized in Azure PowerShell

#### Problem

If you try to run any of the Service Fabric PowerShell cmdlets, such as `Connect-ServiceFabricCluster` in an Azure PowerShell window, it fails, saying that the cmdlet is not recognized. The reason for this is that Azure PowerShell uses the 32-bit version of Windows PowerShell (even on 64-bit OS versions), whereas the Service Fabric cmdlets only work in 64-bit environments.

#### Solution

Always run Service Fabric cmdlets directly from Windows PowerShell.

>[AZURE.NOTE] The latest version of Azure PowerShell does not create a special shortcut, so this should no longer occur.

### Type Initialization exception

#### Problem

When you are connecting to the cluster in PowerShell, you see the error TypeInitializationException for System.Fabric.Common.AppTrace.

#### Solution

Your path variable was not correctly set during installation. Please sign out of Windows and sign back in. This will fully refresh your path.

### Cluster connection fails with "Object is closed"

#### Problem

A call to Connect-ServiceFabricCluster fails with an error like this:

    Connect-ServiceFabricCluster : The object is closed.
    At line:1 char:1
    + Connect-ServiceFabricCluster
    + ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    + CategoryInfo : InvalidOperation: (:) [Connect-ServiceFabricCluster], FabricObjectClosedException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : CreateClusterConnectionErrorId,Microsoft.ServiceFabric.Powershell.ConnectCluster

#### Solution

Close the current PowerShell window and open a new PowerShell window as an administrator. You should now be able to successfully connect.

### Fabric Connection Denied exception

#### Problem

When debugging from Visual Studio, you get a FabricConnectionDeniedException error.

#### Solution

This error usually occurs when you try to try to start a service host process manually, rather than allowing the Service Fabric runtime to start it for you.

Ensure that you do not have any service projects set as startup projects in your solution. Only Service Fabric application projects should be set as startup projects.
