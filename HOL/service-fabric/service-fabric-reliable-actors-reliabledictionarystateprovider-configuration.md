# Configuring Reliable Actors--ReliableDictionaryActorStateProvider
You can modify the default configuration of ReliableDictionaryActorStateProvider by changing the settings.xml file generated in the Visual Studio package root under the Config folder for the specified actor.

The Azure Service Fabric runtime looks for predefined section names in the settings.xml file and consumes the configuration values while creating the underlying runtime components.

>[AZURE.NOTE] Do **not** delete or modify the section names of the following configurations in the settings.xml file that is generated in the Visual Studio solution.

There are also global settings that affect the configuration of ReliableDictionaryActorStateProvider.

## Global Configuration

The global configuration is specified in the cluster manifest for the cluster under the KtlLogger section. It allows configuration of the shared log location and size plus the global memory limits used by the logger. Note that changes in the cluster manifest affect all services that use ReliableDictionaryActorStateProvider and reliable stateful services.

The cluster manifest is a single XML file that holds settings and configurations that apply to all nodes and services in the cluster. The file is typically called ClusterManifest.xml. You can see the cluster manifest for your cluster using the Get-ServiceFabricClusterManifest powershell command.

### Configuration names

|Name|Unit|Default value|Remarks|
|----|----|-------------|-------|
|WriteBufferMemoryPoolMinimumInKB|Kilobytes|8388608|Minimum number of KB to allocate in kernel mode for the logger write buffer memory pool. This memory pool is used for caching state information before writing to disk.|
|WriteBufferMemoryPoolMaximumInKB|Kilobytes|No Limit|Maximum size to which the logger write buffer memory pool can grow.|
|SharedLogId|GUID|""|Specifies a unique GUID to use for identifying the default shared log file used by all reliable services on all nodes in the cluster that do not specify the SharedLogId in their service specific configuration. If SharedLogId is specified, then SharedLogPath must also be specified.|
|SharedLogPath|Fully qualified path name|""|Specifies the fully qualified path where the shared log file used by all reliable services on all nodes in the cluster that do not specify the SharedLogPath in their service specific configuration. However, if SharedLogPath is specified, then SharedLogId must also be specified.|
|SharedLogSizeInMB|Megabytes|8192|Specifies the number of MB of disk space to statically allocate for the shared log. The value must be 2048 or larger.|

### Sample cluster manifest section
```xml
   <Section Name="KtlLogger">
     <Parameter Name="WriteBufferMemoryPoolMinimumInKB" Value="8192" />
     <Parameter Name="WriteBufferMemoryPoolMaximumInKB" Value="8192" />
     <Parameter Name="SharedLogId" Value="{7668BB54-FE9C-48ed-81AC-FF89E60ED2EF}"/>
     <Parameter Name="SharedLogPath" Value="f:\SharedLog.Log"/>
     <Parameter Name="SharedLogSizeInMB" Value="16383"/>
   </Section>
```

### Remarks
The logger has a global pool of memory allocated from non paged kernel memory that is available to all reliable services on a node for caching state data before being written to the dedicated log associated with the reliable service replica. The pool size is controlled by the WriteBufferMemoryPoolMinimumInKB and WriteBufferMemoryPoolMaximumInKB settings. WriteBufferMemoryPoolMinimumInKB specifies both the initial size of this memory pool and the lowest size to which the memory pool may shrink. WriteBufferMemoryPoolMaximumInKB is the highest size to which the memory pool may grow. Each reliable service replica that is opened may increase the size of the memory pool by a system determined amount up to WriteBufferMemoryPoolMaximumInKB. If there is more demand for memory from the memory pool than is available, requests for memory will be delayed until memory is available. Therefore if the write buffer memory pool is too small for a particular configuration then performance may suffer.

The SharedLogId and SharedLogPath settings are always used together to define the GUID and location for the default shared log for all nodes in the cluster. The default shared log is used for all reliable services that do not specify the settings in the settings.xml for the specific service. For best performance, shared log files should be placed on disks that are used solely for the shared log file to reduce contention.

SharedLogSizeInMB specifies the amount of disk space to preallocate for the default shared log on all nodes.  SharedLogId and SharedLogPath do not need to be specified in order for SharedLogSizeInMB to be specified.

## Replicator security configuration
Replicator security configurations are used to secure the communication channel that is used during replication. This means that services cannot see each other's replication traffic, ensuring the data that is made highly available is also secure.
By default, an empty security configuration section prevents replication security.

### Section name
&lt;ActorName&gt;ServiceReplicatorSecurityConfig

## Replicator configuration
Replicator configurations are used to configure the replicator that is responsible for making the Actor State Provider state highly reliable by replicating and persisting the state locally.
The default configuration is generated by the Visual Studio template and should suffice. This section talks about additional configurations that are available to tune the replicator.

### Section name
&lt;ActorName&gt;ServiceReplicatorConfig

### Configuration names

|Name|Unit|Default value|Remarks|
|----|----|-------------|-------|
|BatchAcknowledgementInterval|Seconds|0.05|Time period for which the replicator at the secondary waits after receiving an operation before sending back an acknowledgement to the primary. Any other acknowledgements to be sent for operations processed within this interval are sent as one response.||
|ReplicatorEndpoint|N/A|No default--required parameter|IP address and port that the primary/secondary replicator will use to communicate with other replicators in the replica set. This should reference a TCP resource endpoint in the service manifest. Refer to [Service manifest resources](service-fabric-service-manifest-resources.md) to read more about defining endpoint resources in service manifest. |
|MaxReplicationMessageSize|Bytes|50 MB|Maximum size of replication data that can be transmitted in a single message.|
|MaxPrimaryReplicationQueueSize|Number of operations|8192|Maximum number of operations in the primary queue. An operation is freed up after the primary replicator receives an acknowledgement from all the secondary replicators. This value must be greater than 64 and a power of 2.|
|MaxSecondaryReplicationQueueSize|Number of operations|16384|Maximum number of operations in the secondary queue. An operation is freed up after making its state highly available through persistence. This value must be greater than 64 and a power of 2.|
|CheckpointThresholdInMB|MB|200|Amount of log file space after which the state is checkpointed.|
|MaxRecordSizeInKB|KB|1024|Largest record size that the replicator may write in the log. This value must be a multiple of 4 and greater than 16.|
|OptimizeLogForLowerDiskUsage|Boolean|true|When true, the log is configured so that the replica's dedicated log file is created by using an NTFS sparse file. This lowers the actual disk space usage for the file. When false, the file is created with fixed allocations, which provide the best write performance.|
|SharedLogId|guid|""|Specifies a unique guid to use for identifying the shared log file used with this replica. Typically, services should not use this setting. However, if SharedLogId is specified, then SharedLogPath must also be specified.|
|SharedLogPath|Fully qualified path name|""|Specifies the fully qualified path where the shared log file for this replica will be created. Typically, services should not use this setting. However, if SharedLogPath is specified, then SharedLogId must also be specified.|

## Remarks
The BatchAcknowledgementInterval parameter controls replication latency. A value of '0' results in the lowest possible latency, at the cost of throughput (as more acknowledgement messages must be sent and processed, each containing fewer acknowledgements).
The larger the value for BatchAcknowledgementInterval, the higher the overall replication throughput, at the cost of higher operation latency. This directly translates to the latency of transaction commits.

The CheckpointThresholdInMB parameter controls the amount of disk space that the replicator can use to store state information in the replica's dedicated log file. Increasing this to a higher value than the default could result in faster reconfiguration times when a new replica is added to the set. This is due to the partial state transfer that takes place due to the availability of more history of operations in the log. This can potentially increase the recovery time of a replica after a crash.

If you set OptimizeForLowerDiskUsage to true, log file space will be over-provisioned so that active replicas can store more state information in their log files, while inactive replicas will use less disk space. This makes it possible to host more replicas on a node. If you set OptimizeForLowerDiskUsage to false, the state information is written to the log files more quickly.

The MaxRecordSizeInKB setting defines the maximum size of a record that can be written by the replicator into the log file. In most cases, the default 1024-KB record size is optimal. However, if the service is causing larger data items to be part of the state information, then this value might need to be increased. There is little benefit in making MaxRecordSizeInKB smaller than 1024, as smaller records use only the space needed for the smaller record. We expect that this value would need to be changed only in rare cases.

The SharedLogId and SharedLogPath settings are always used together to make a service use a separate shared log from the default shared log for the node. For best efficiency, as many services as possible should specify the same shared log. Shared log files should be placed on disks that are used solely for the shared log file, to reduce head movement contention. We expect that these values would need to be changed only in rare cases.
