# RunAs: Run a Service Fabric application with different security permissions
Azure Service Fabric provides the ability to secure applications running in the cluster under different user accounts, known as **RunAs**. Service Fabric also secures the resources used by the applications with the user account such as files, directories, and certificates.

By default, Service Fabric applications run under the account that the Fabric.exe process runs under. Service Fabric also provides the capability to run applications under a local user account or local system account, specified within the application’s manifest. Supported local system account types for RunAs are **LocalUser**, **NetworkService**, **LocalService** and **LocalSystem**.

> [AZURE.NOTE] Domain accounts are supported on Windows Server deployments where Azure Active Directory is available.

User groups can be defined and created so that one or more users can be added to each group to be managed together. This is particularly useful when there are multiple users for different service entry points and they need to have certain common privileges that are available at the group level.

## Set the RunAs policy for SetupEntryPoint

As described in the [application model](service-fabric-application-model.md) the **SetupEntryPoint** is a privileged entry point that runs with the same credentials as Service Fabric (typically the *NetworkService* account) before any other entry point. The executable specified by **EntryPoint** is typically the long-running service host, so having a separate setup entry point avoids having to run the service host executable with high privileges for extended periods of time. The executable specified by **EntryPoint** is run after **SetupEntryPoint** exits successfully. The resulting process is monitored and restarted (beginning again with **SetupEntryPoint**) if it ever terminates or crashes.

Below is a simple service manifest example that shows SetupEntryPoint and the main EntryPoint for the service.

~~~
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<ServiceManifest Name="MyServiceManifest" Version="SvcManifestVersion1" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2011/01/fabric" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
  <Description>An example service manifest</Description>
  <ServiceTypes>
    <StatelessServiceType ServiceTypeName="MyServiceType" />
  </ServiceTypes>
  <CodePackage Name="Code" Version="1.0.0">
    <SetupEntryPoint>
      <ExeHost>
        <Program>MySetup.bat</Program>
        <WorkingFolder>CodePackage</WorkingFolder>
      </ExeHost>
    </SetupEntryPoint>
    <EntryPoint>
      <ExeHost>
        <Program>MyServiceHost.exe</Program>
      </ExeHost>
    </EntryPoint>
  </CodePackage>
  <ConfigPackage Name="Config" Version="1.0.0" />
</ServiceManifest>
~~~

### Configure the RunAs policy using a local account

After you configure the service to have a setup entry point, you can change the security permissions that it runs under in the application manifest. The example below shows how to configure the service to run under user administrator account privileges.

~~~
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<ApplicationManifest xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" ApplicationTypeName="MyApplicationType" ApplicationTypeVersion="1.0.0" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2011/01/fabric">
   <ServiceManifestImport>
      <ServiceManifestRef ServiceManifestName="MyServiceTypePkg" ServiceManifestVersion="1.0.0" />
      <ConfigOverrides />
      <Policies>
         <RunAsPolicy CodePackageRef="Code" UserRef="SetupAdminUser" EntryPointType="Setup" />
      </Policies>
   </ServiceManifestImport>
   <Principals>
      <Users>
         <User Name="SetupAdminUser">
            <MemberOf>
               <SystemGroup Name="Administrators" />
            </MemberOf>
         </User>
      </Users>
   </Principals>
</ApplicationManifest>
~~~

First, create a **Principals** section with a user name, such as SetupAdminUser. This indicates that the user is a member of the Administrators system group.

Next, under the **ServiceManifestImport** section, configure a policy to apply this principal to **SetupEntryPoint**. This tells Service Fabric that when the **MySetup.bat** file is run, it should be RunAs with administrator privileges. Given that you have *not* applied a policy to the main entry point, the code in **MyServiceHost.exe** will run under the system **NetworkService** account. This is the default account that all service entry points are run as.

Let's now add the file MySetup.bat to the Visual Studio project to test the administrator privileges. In Visual Studio, right-click on the service project and add a new file call MySetup.bat.

Next, ensure that the MySetup.bat file is included in the service package. By default, it is not. Select the file, right-click to get the context menu, and choose **Properties**. In the properties dialog box, ensure that **Copy to Output Directory** is set to **Copy if newer**. This is shown in the screen shot below.

![Visual Studio CopyToOutput for SetupEntryPoint batch file][image1]

Now open the MySetup.bat file and add the following commands:

~~~
REM Set a system environment variable. This requires administrator privilege
setx -m TestVariable "MyValue"
echo System TestVariable set to > out.txt
echo %TestVariable% >> out.txt

REM To delete this system variable us
REM REG delete "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Environment" /v TestVariable /f
~~~

Next, build and deploy the solution to a local development cluster.  Once the service has started, as shown in Service Fabric Explorer, you can see that the MySetup.bat was successful in a two ways. Open a PowerShell command prompt and type:

~~~
PS C:\ [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("TestVariable","Machine")
MyValue
~~~

Then, note the name of the node where the service was deployed and started in the Service Fabric Explorer, for example, Node 2. Next, navigate to the application instance work folder to find the out.txt file that shows the value of **TestVariable**. For example if this was deployed to Node 2, then you can go to this path for the **MyApplicationType**:

~~~
C:\SfDevCluster\Data\_App\Node.2\MyApplicationType_App\work\out.txt
~~~

###  Configure the RunAs policy using local system accounts
Often it is preferrable to run the start up script using a local system account rather than an admistrators account as shown above. Running the RunAs policy as Administrators typically doesn’t work well since machines have User Access Control (UAC) enabled by default. In such cases **the recommendation is to run the SetupEntryPoint as LocalSystem instead of a local user added to administrators group**. The example below shows setting the SetupEntryPoint to run as LocalSystem.

~~~
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<ApplicationManifest xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" ApplicationTypeName="MyApplicationType" ApplicationTypeVersion="1.0.0" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2011/01/fabric">
   <ServiceManifestImport>
      <ServiceManifestRef ServiceManifestName="MyServiceTypePkg" ServiceManifestVersion="1.0.0" />
      <ConfigOverrides />
      <Policies>
         <RunAsPolicy CodePackageRef="Code" UserRef="SetupLocalSystem" EntryPointType="Setup" />
      </Policies>
   </ServiceManifestImport>
   <Principals>
      <Users>
         <User Name="SetupLocalSystem" AccountType="LocalSystem" />
      </Users>
   </Principals>
</ApplicationManifest>
~~~

##  Launch PowerShell commands from SetupEntryPoint
To run PowerShell from the **SetupEntryPoint** point, you can run **PowerShell.exe** in a batch file that points to a PowerShell file. First, add a PowerShell file to the service project, such as **MySetup.ps1**. Remember to set the *Copy if newer* property so that the file is also included in the service package. The example below shows a sample batch file to launch a PowerShell file called MySetup.ps1, which sets a system environment variable called **TestVariable**.


MySetup.bat to launch PowerShell file.

~~~
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command ".\MySetup.ps1"
~~~

In the PowerShell file, add the following to set a system environment variable:

~~~
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("TestVariable", "MyValue", "Machine")
[Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("TestVariable","Machine") > out.txt
~~~

**Note:** By default when the batch file runs it looks at the application folder called **work** for files. In this case when MySetup.bat runs we want this to find the MySetup.ps1 in the same folder, which is the application **code package** folder. To change this folder, set the working folder as shown below.
    
~~~
<SetupEntryPoint>
    <ExeHost>
    <Program>MySetup.bat</Program>
    <WorkingFolder>CodePackage</WorkingFolder>
    </ExeHost>
</SetupEntryPoint> 
~~~

## Using console redirection policy for local debugging of entry points
Occassional it is useful to see the console output from running a script for debugging purposes. In order to do this you can set a console redirection policy which writes the output to a file. The file output is written to the application folder called **log** on the node where the applicaiton is deployed and run (see where to find this in the example above).

**Note: Never** use the console redirection policy in an application deployed in production since this can impact the application failover. **ONLY** use this for local development and debugging purposes.  

The example below shows setting the console redirection with a FileRetentionCount value. 

~~~
<SetupEntryPoint>
    <ExeHost>
    <Program>MySetup.bat</Program>
    <WorkingFolder>CodePackage</WorkingFolder>
    <ConsoleRedirection FileRetentionCount="10"/>
    </ExeHost>
</SetupEntryPoint> 
~~~

If you now change the the MySetup.ps1 file to write an **Echo** command, this will write to the output file for debugging purposes. 

~~~
Echo "Test console redirection which writes to the application log folder on the node that the application is deployed to" 
~~~

**Once you have debugged your script, immediately remove this console redirection policy**

## Apply RunAsPolicy to services
In the steps above, you saw how to apply RunAs policy to SetupEntryPoint. Let's look a little deeper into how to create different principals that can be applied as service policies.

### Create local user groups
User groups can be defined and created that allow one or more users to be added to a group. This is particularly useful if there are multiple users for different service entry points and they need to have certain common privileges that are available at the group level. The example below shows a local group called **LocalAdminGroup** with administrator privileges. Two users, Customer1 and Customer2, are made members of this local group.

~~~
<Principals>
 <Groups>
   <Group Name="LocalAdminGroup">
     <Membership>
       <SystemGroup Name="Administrators"/>
     </Membership>
   </Group>
 </Groups>
  <Users>
     <User Name="Customer1">
        <MemberOf>
           <Group NameRef="LocalAdminGroup" />
        </MemberOf>
     </User>
    <User Name="Customer2">
      <MemberOf>
        <Group NameRef="LocalAdminGroup" />
      </MemberOf>
    </User>
  </Users>
</Principals>
~~~

### Create local users
You can create a local user that can be used to secure a service within the application. When a **LocalUser** account type is specified in the principals section of the application manifest, Service Fabric creates local user accounts on machines where the application is deployed. By default, these accounts do not have the same names as those specified in the application manifest (for example, Customer3 in the sample below). Instead, they are dynamically generated and have random passwords.

~~~
<Principals>
  <Users>
     <User Name="Customer3" AccountType="LocalUser" />
  </Users>
</Principals>
~~~

<!-- If an application requires that the user account and password be same on all machines (for example, to enable NTLM authentication), the cluster manifest must set NTLMAuthenticationEnabled to true. The cluster manifest must also specify an NTLMAuthenticationPasswordSecret that will be used to generate the same password across all machines.

<Section Name="Hosting">
      <Parameter Name="EndpointProviderEnabled" Value="true"/>
      <Parameter Name="NTLMAuthenticationEnabled" Value="true"/>
      <Parameter Name="NTLMAuthenticationPassworkSecret" Value="******" IsEncrypted="true"/>
 </Section>
-->

## Assign policies to the service code packages
The **RunAsPolicy** section for a **ServiceManifestImport** specifies the account from the principals section that should be used to run a code package. It also associates code packages from the service manifest with user accounts in the principals section. You can specify this for the setup or main entry points, or you can specify All to apply it to both. The example below shows different policies being applied:

~~~
<Policies>
<RunAsPolicy CodePackageRef="Code" UserRef="LocalAdmin" EntryPointType="Setup"/>
<RunAsPolicy CodePackageRef="Code" UserRef="Customer3" EntryPointType="Main"/>
</Policies>
~~~

If **EntryPointType** is not specified, the default is set to EntryPointType=”Main”. Specifying **SetupEntryPoint** is especially useful when you want to run certain high privilege setup operation under a system account. The actual service code can run under a lower-privilege account.

### Apply a default policy to all service code packages
The **DefaultRunAsPolicy** section is used to specify a default user account for all code packages that don’t have a specific **RunAsPolicy** defined. If most of the code packages specified in service manifests used by an application need to run under the same RunAs user, the application can just define a default RunAs policy with that user account, rather than specifying a **RunAsPolicy** for every code package. The following example specifies that if a code package does not have a **RunAsPolicy** specified, the code package should run under the **MyDefaultAccount** specified in the principals section.

~~~
<Policies>
  <DefaultRunAsPolicy UserRef="MyDefaultAccount"/>
</Policies>
~~~

## Assign SecurityAccessPolicy for HTTP and HTTPS endpoints
If you apply a RunAs policy to a service, and service manifest declares endpoint resources with the HTTP protocol, you must specify a **SecurityAccessPolicy** to ensure that ports allocated to these endpoints are correctly access-control listed for the RunAs user account that the service runs under. Otherwise, **http.sys** does not have access to the service, and you will get failure with calls from the client. The example below applies the Customer3 account to an endpoint called **ServiceEndpointName**, giving it full access rights.

~~~
<Policies>
   <RunAsPolicy CodePackageRef="Code" UserRef="Customer1" />
   <!--SecurityAccessPolicy is needed if RunAsPolicy is defined and the Endpoint is http -->
   <SecurityAccessPolicy ResourceRef="EndpointName" PrincipalRef="Customer1" />
</Policies>
~~~

For the HTTPS endpoint, you also have to indicate the name of the certificate to return to the client. You can do this by using **EndpointBindingPolicy**, with the certificate defined in a certificates section in the application manifest.

~~~
<Policies>
   <RunAsPolicy CodePackageRef="Code" UserRef="Customer1" />
  <!--SecurityAccessPolicy is needed if RunAsPolicy is defined and the Endpoint is http -->
   <SecurityAccessPolicy ResourceRef="EndpointName" PrincipalRef="Customer1" />
  <!--EndpointBindingPolicy is needed if the EndpointName is secured with https -->
  <EndpointBindingPolicy EndpointRef="EndpointName" CertificateRef="Cert1" />
</Policies
~~~
