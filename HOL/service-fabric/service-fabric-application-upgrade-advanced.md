# Service Fabric application upgrade: advanced topics

## Adding or removing services during an application upgrade

If a new service is added to an application that is already deployed, and published as an upgrade, the new service will be added to the deployed application (without the upgrade affecting any of the services that were already part of the application). However, an instance of the service that was added will have to be started for the new service to be active (using the `New-ServiceFabricService` cmdlet).

Services can also be removed from an application as part of an upgrade, however, one needs to ensure that all current instances of the service (that is to be removed as part of the upgrade) are stopped before proceeding with the upgrade (using the `Remove-ServiceFabricService` cmdlet). 

## Manual upgrade mode

> [AZURE.NOTE]  The unmonitored manual mode should  be considered only for a failed or suspended upgrade. The monitored mode is the recommended upgrade mode for Service Fabric applications.

Azure Service Fabric provides multiple upgrade modes to support development and production clusters. Each of the deployment options are ideal for different environments.

The monitored rolling application upgrade is the most typical upgrade to use in production. When the upgrade policy is specified, Service Fabric ensures that the application is healthy before the upgrade proceeds.

 The application administrator can use the manual rolling application upgrade mode to have total control over the upgrade progress through the various upgrade domains. This mode is useful for certain situations where a more customized or complex health evaluation policy is required, or where there's a non-conventional upgrade (for example, application is already in data loss).

Finally, the automated rolling application upgrade is useful for development or testing environments to provide a fast iteration cycle during service development.

## Change to manual upgrade mode
**Manual**--Stop the application upgrade at the current UD and change the upgrade mode to Unmonitored Manual. The administrator needs to manually call **MoveNextApplicationUpgradeDomainAsync** to proceed with the upgrade or trigger a rollback by initiating a new upgrade. Once the upgrade enters into the Manual mode, it stays in the Manual mode until a new upgrade is initiated. The **GetApplicationUpgradeProgressAsync** command returns FABRIC\_APPLICATION\_UPGRADE\_STATE\_ROLLING\_FORWARD\_PENDING.

## Upgrade with a diff package

A Service Fabric application can be upgraded by provisioning with a full, self-contained application package. An application can also be upgraded by using a diff package that contains only the updated application files, the updated application manifest, and the service manifest files.

A full application package contains all the files necessary to start and run a Service Fabric application. A diff package contains only the files that changed between the last provision and the current upgrade, plus the full application manifest and the service manifest files. Any reference in the application manifest or service manifest that Service Fabric can't find in the build layout, Service Fabric will search for in the image store.

Full application packages are required for the first installation of an application to the cluster. Subsequent updates can be either a full application package or a diff package.

Occasions when using a diff package would be a good choice:

* A diff package is preferred when you have a large application package that references several service manifest files and/or several code packages, config packages, or data packages.

* A diff package is preferred when you have a deployment system that generates the build layout directly from your application build process. In this case, even though nothing in the code has changed, newly built assemblies will have a different checksum. Using a full application package would require you to update the version on all code packages. Using a diff package, you only provide the files that changed and the manifest files where the version has changed.

When an application is upgraded using Visual Studio, the diff package is published automatically. If you wanted to create a diff package manually (e.g., for upgrading using PowerShell), you should update the application and service manifests, but only include the packages that were changed in the final application package. 

For example, let's start with the following application (version numbers provided for ease of understanding):

```text
app1       	1.0.0
  service1 	1.0.0
    code   	1.0.0
    config 	1.0.0
  service2 	1.0.0
    code   	1.0.0
    config 	1.0.0
```

Now, let's assume you wanted to update only the code package of service1 using a diff package using PowerShell. Now, your updated application will look like the following:

```text
app1       	2.0.0      <-- new version
  service1 	2.0.0      <-- new version
    code   	2.0.0      <-- new version
    config 	1.0.0
  service2 	1.0.0
    code   	1.0.0
    config 	1.0.0
```

In this case, you update the application manifest to 2.0.0, and the service manifest for service1 to reflect the code package update. The folder structure for your application package would look like the following:

```text
app1/
  service1/
    code/
```
