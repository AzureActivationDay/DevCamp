# Actor timers and reminders
Actors can schedule periodic work on themselves by register either timers or reminders. This article shows how to use timers and reminders and explains the differences between them.

## Actor timers
Actor timers provide a simple wrapper around .NET timer to ensure that the callback methods respect the turn-based concurrency guarantees that the Actors runtime provides.

Actors can use the `RegisterTimer` and `UnregisterTimer` methods on their base class to register and unregister their timers. The example below shows the use of timer APIs. The APIs are very similar to the .NET timer. In this example, when the timer is due, the Actors runtime will call the `MoveObject` method. The method is guaranteed to respect the turn-based concurrency. This means that no other actor methods or timer/reminder callbacks will be in progress until this callback completes execution.

```csharp
class VisualObjectActor : Actor, IVisualObject
{
    private IActorTimer _updateTimer;

    protected override Task OnActivateAsync()
    {
        ...

        _updateTimer = RegisterTimer(
            MoveObject,                     // Callback method
            null,                           // Parameter to pass to the callback method
            TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(15),  // Amount of time to delay before the callback is invoked
            TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(15)); // Time interval between invocations of the callback method

        return base.OnActivateAsync();
    }

    protected override Task OnDeactivateAsync()
    {
        if (_updateTimer != null)
        {
            UnregisterTimer(_updateTimer);
        }

        return base.OnDeactivateAsync();
    }

    private Task MoveObject(object state)
    {
        ...
        return Task.FromResult(true);
    }
}
```

The next period of the timer starts after the callback completes execution. This implies that the timer is stopped while the callback is executing and is started when the callback finishes.

The Actors runtime saves changes made to the actor's State Manager when the callback finishes. If an error occurs in saving the state, that actor object will be deactivated and a new instance will be activated. 

All timers are stopped when the actor is deactivated as part of garbage collection. No timer callbacks are invoked after that. Also, the Actors runtime does not retain any information about the timers that were running before deactivation. It is up to the actor to register any timers that it needs when it is reactivated in the future. For more information, see the section on [actor garbage collection](service-fabric-reliable-actors-lifecycle.md).

## Actor reminders
Reminders are a mechanism to trigger persistent callbacks on an actor at specified times. Their functionality is similar to timers. But unlike timers, reminders are triggered under all circumstances until the actor explicitly unregisters them or the actor is explicitly deleted. Specifically, reminders are triggered across actor deactivations and failovers because the Actors runtime persists information about the actor's reminders.

To register a reminder, an actor calls the `RegisterReminderAsync` method provided on the base class, as shown in the following example:

```csharp
protected override async Task OnActivateAsync()
{
    string reminderName = "Pay cell phone bill";
    int amountInDollars = 100;

    IActorReminder reminderRegistration = await this.RegisterReminderAsync(
        reminderName,
        BitConverter.GetBytes(amountInDollars),
        TimeSpan.FromDays(3),
        TimeSpan.FromDays(1));
}
```

In this example, `"Pay cell phone bill"` is the reminder name. This is a string that the actor uses to uniquely identify a reminder. `BitConverter.GetBytes(amountInDollars)` is the context that is associated with the reminder. It will be passed back to the actor as an argument to the reminder callback, i.e. `IRemindable.ReceiveReminderAsync`.

Actors that use reminders must implement the `IRemindable` interface, as shown in the example below.

```csharp
public class ToDoListActor : Actor, IToDoListActor, IRemindable
{
    public Task ReceiveReminderAsync(string reminderName, byte[] context, TimeSpan dueTime, TimeSpan period)
    {
        if (reminderName.Equals("Pay cell phone bill"))
        {
            int amountToPay = BitConverter.ToInt32(context, 0);
            System.Console.WriteLine("Please pay your cell phone bill of ${0}!", amountToPay);
        }
        return Task.FromResult(true);
    }
}
```

When a reminder is triggered, the Reliable Actors runtime will invoke the  `ReceiveReminderAsync` method on the Actor. An actor can register multiple reminders, and the `ReceiveReminderAsync` method is invoked when any of those reminders is triggered. The actor can use the reminder name that is passed in to the `ReceiveReminderAsync` method to figure out which reminder was triggered.

The Actors runtime saves the actor state when the `ReceiveReminderAsync` call finishes. If an error occurs in saving the state, that actor object will be deactivated and a new instance will be activated. To specify that the state need not be saved upon completion of the reminder callback, the `ActorReminderAttributes.ReadOnly` flag can be set in the `attributes` parameter when the `RegisterReminder` method is called to create the reminder.

To unregister a reminder, an actor calls the `UnregisterReminder` method, as shown in the example below.

```csharp
IActorReminder reminder = GetReminder("Pay cell phone bill");
Task reminderUnregistration = UnregisterReminder(reminder);
```

As shown above, the `UnregisterReminder` method accepts an `IActorReminder` interface. The actor base class supports a `GetReminder` method that can be used to retrieve the `IActorReminder` interface by passing in the reminder name. This is convenient because the actor does not need to persist the `IActorReminder` interface that was returned from the `RegisterReminder` method call.
