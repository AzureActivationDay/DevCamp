# Service Fabric on Linux

Service Fabric is currently available as a limited preview on Linux, enabling you to build, deploy, and manage highly available, highly scalable applications in that environment just as you would on Windows. In addition, the high-level Service Fabric frameworks (Reliable Services and Reliable Actors) can now be built in Java.

## Supported operating systems and programming languages

The limited preview supports the creation of one-box development clusters as well as multi-machine clusters in Azure running Ubuntu Server 15.10.

You can build [guest executable services](service-fabric-deploy-existing-app.md) with any language or framework. You can also use Java to build services based on the Reliable Services and Reliable Actor frameworks.

>[AZURE.NOTE] Reliable Collections are not supported in Java yet.

## Participate in the preview

If you are interested in being considered for the limited preview program, [please fill out the survey](http://aka.ms/sflinuxsurvey) so that we can better understand your scenario and requirements. The preview will be very small at first and will expand over time.

Please note that Service Fabric on Linux will be conceptually equivalent to what is available on Windows (except for OS specifics and programming language support), so most of our [existing documentation](http://aka.ms/servicefabricdocs) applies and will help you get familiar with the technology.

## Next steps

Get familiar with the [Reliable Actors](service-fabric-reliable-actors-introduction.md) and [Reliable Services](service-fabric-reliable-services-introduction.md) programming frameworks.
