# Getting started with Reliable Actors
This article explains the basics of Azure Service Fabric Reliable Actors and walks you through creating, debugging, and deploying a simple Reliable Actor application in Visual Studio.

## Installation and setup
Before you start, ensure that you have the Service Fabric development environment set up on your machine.
If you need to set it up, see detailed instructions on [how to set up the development environment](service-fabric-get-started.md).

## Basic concepts
To get started with Reliable Actors, you need to understand just four basic concepts:

* **Actor service**. Reliable Actors are packaged in Reliable Services that can be deployed in the Service Fabric infrastructure. A service can host one or more actors. We will go into more detail about the trade-offs of one actor versus multiple actors per service below. For now, let's assume that we need to implement only one actor.
* **Actor interface**. The actor interface is used to define a strongly-typed public interface of an actor. In the Reliable Actor model terminology, the actor interface defines the types of messages that the actor can understand and process. The actor interface is used by other actors and client applications to "send" (asynchronously) messages to the actor. Reliable Actors can implement multiple interfaces. As we will see, a HelloWorld actor can implement the IHelloWorld interface, but it can also implement an ILogging interface that defines different messages and/or functionalities.
* **Actor registration**. In the Reliable Actors service, the actor type needs to be registered. This way, Service Fabric is aware of the new type and can use it to create new actors.
* **ActorProxy class**. The ActorProxy class is used by client applications to invoke the methods exposed through its interfaces. The ActorProxy class provides two important functionalities:
	* It resolves names. It is able to locate the actor in the cluster (find the node of the cluster where it is hosted).
	* It handles failures. It can retry method invocations and re-determine the actor location after, for example, a failure that requires the actor to be relocated to another node in the cluster.

The following rules that pertain to actor interface methods are worth mentioning:

- Actor interface methods cannot be overloaded.
- Actor interface methods must not have out, ref, or optional parameters.

## Create a new project in Visual Studio
After you have installed the Service Fabric tools for Visual Studio, you can create new project types. The new project types are under the **Cloud** category of the **New Project** dialog box.

In the next dialog box, you can choose the type of project that you want to create.

For the HelloWorld project, let's use the Service Fabric Reliable Actors service.

After you have created the solution, you should see the following structure:

![Service Fabric project structure][2]

## Reliable Actors basic building blocks

A typical Reliable Actors solution is composed of three projects:

* **The application project (MyActorApplication)**. This is the project that packages all of the services together for deployment. It contains the *ApplicationManifest.xml* and PowerShell scripts for managing the application.

* **The interface project (MyActor.Interfaces)**. This is the project that contains the interface definition for the actor. In the MyActor.Interfaces project, you can define the interfaces that will be used by the actors in the solution. Your actor interfaces can be defined in any project with any name, however the interface defines the actor contract that is shared by the actor implementation and the clients calling the actor, so it typically makes sense to define it in an assembly that is separate from the actor implementation and can be shared by multiple other projects.

```csharp
public interface IMyActor : IActor
{
    Task<string> HelloWorld();
}
```

* **The actor service project (MyActor)**. This is the project used to define the Service Fabric service that is going to host the actor. It contains the implementation of the actor. An actor implementation is a class that derives from the base type `Actor` and implements the interface(s) that are defined in the MyActor.Interfaces project.

```csharp
[StatePersistence(StatePersistence.Persisted)]
internal class MyActor : Actor, IMyActor
{
    public Task<string> HelloWorld()
    {
        return Task.FromResult("Hello world!");
    }
}
```

The actor service must be registered with a service type in the Service Fabric runtime. In order for the Actor Service to run your actor instances, your actor type must also be registered with the Actor Service. The `ActorRuntime` registration method performs this work for actors.

```csharp
internal static class Program
{
    private static void Main()
    {
        try
        {
            ActorRuntime.RegisterActorAsync<MyActor>(
                (context, actorType) => new ActorService(context, actorType, () => new MyActor())).GetAwaiter().GetResult();

            Thread.Sleep(Timeout.Infinite);
        }
        catch (Exception e)
        {
            ActorEventSource.Current.ActorHostInitializationFailed(e.ToString());
            throw;
        }
    }
}

```

If you start from a new project in Visual Studio and you have only one actor definition, the registration is included by default in the code that Visual Studio generates. If you define other actors in the service, you need to add the actor registration by using:

```csharp
 ActorRuntime.RegisterActorAsync<MyOtherActor>();

```

> [AZURE.TIP] The Service Fabric Actors runtime emits some [events and performance counters related to actor methods](service-fabric-reliable-actors-diagnostics.md#actor-method-events-and-performance-counters). They are useful in diagnostics and performance monitoring.


## Debugging

The Service Fabric tools for Visual Studio support debugging on your local machine. You can start a debugging session by hitting the F5 key. Visual Studio builds (if necessary) packages. It also deploys the application on the local Service Fabric cluster and attaches the debugger.

During the deployment process, you can see the progress in the **Output** window.
