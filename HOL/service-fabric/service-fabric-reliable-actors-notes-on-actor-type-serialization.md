# Notes on Service Fabric Reliable Actors type serialization


The arguments of all methods, result types of the tasks returned by each method in an actor interface, and objects stored in an actor's State Manager must be [Data Contract serializable](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms731923.aspx).. This also applies to the arguments of the methods defined in [actor event interfaces](service-fabric-reliable-actors-events.md#actor-events). (Actor event interface methods always return void.)

## Custom data types

In this example, the following actor interface defines a method that returns a custom data type called `VoicemailBox`.

```csharp
public interface IVoiceMailBoxActor : IActor
{
    Task<VoicemailBox> GetMailBoxAsync();
}
```

The interface is impelemented by an actor, which uses the State Manager to store a `VoicemailBox` object:

```csharp
[StatePersistence(StatePersistence.Persisted)]
public class VoiceMailBoxActor : Actor, IVoicemailBoxActor
{
    public Task<VoicemailBox> GetMailboxAsync()
    {
        return this.StateManager.GetStateAsync<VoicemailBox>("Mailbox");
    }
}

```

In this example, the `VoicemailBox` object is serialized when:
 - The object is transmitted between an actor instance and a caller.
 - The object is saved in the State Manager where it is persisted to disk and replicated to other nodes.
 
The Reliable Actor framework uses DataContract serialization. Therefore, the custom data objects and their members must be annotated with the **DataContract** and **DataMember** attributes, respectively

```csharp
[DataContract]
public class Voicemail
{
    [DataMember]
    public Guid Id { get; set; }

    [DataMember]
    public string Message { get; set; }

    [DataMember]
    public DateTime ReceivedAt { get; set; }
}
```

```csharp
[DataContract]
public class VoicemailBox
{
    public VoicemailBox()
    {
        this.MessageList = new List<Voicemail>();
    }

    [DataMember]
    public List<Voicemail> MessageList { get; set; }

    [DataMember]
    public string Greeting { get; set; }
}
```
