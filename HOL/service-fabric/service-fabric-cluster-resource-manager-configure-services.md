# Configuring cluster resource manager settings for service fabric services
The Service Fabric Cluster Resource manager allows very fine grained control over the rules which govern every individual named service. Each Service instance can specify specific rules for how it should be allocated in the cluster, and can define the set of metrics that it wants to report, including how important they are to that service. Generally configuring services breaks down into three different tasks:

1. Configuring placement constraints
2. Configuring metrics
3. Configuring advanced placement rules (less common)

Let's talk about each of these in turn:

## Placement constraints
Placement constraints are used to control which nodes in the cluster a service can actually run on. Typically you'll see a particular named service instance or all services of a type constrained to run on a particular type of node, but placement constraints are extensible - you can define any set of properties on a node type basis, and then select for them with constraints when the service is created. Placement constraints are also dynamically updatable over the lifetime of the service, allowing you to respond to changes in the cluster.

## Metrics
Metrics are the list of resources that this service should be balanced on, including information about how much of that resource each replica or instance of that service consumes by default. Metrics also include a weight which indicates how important that metric is to the service, in case tradeoffs are necessary.

## Other placement rules
There are other types of placement rules that are mainly useful in clusters which are geographically distributed, or in other less common scenarios. These are configured via either Correlations or Policies. While they're not used in a lot of scenarios, we'll describe them for completeness.

## Next steps
- Metrics are how the Service Fabric Cluster Resource Manger manages consumption and capacity in the cluster. To learn more about them and how to configure them check out [this article](service-fabric-cluster-resource-manager-metrics.md)
- Affinity is one mode you can configure for your services. It is not common, but if you need it you can learn about it [here](service-fabric-cluster-resource-manager-advanced-placement-rules-affinity.md)
- There are many different placement rules that can be configured on your service to handle additional scenarios. You can find out about those different placement policies [here](service-fabric-cluster-resource-manager-advanced-placement-rules-placement-policies.md)
