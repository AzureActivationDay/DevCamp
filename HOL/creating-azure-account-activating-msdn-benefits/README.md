===================================================================

What is Azure? In short, it’s Microsoft’s cloud platform: a growing collection of integrated services —compute, storage, data, networking, and apps— that help you move faster, do more, and save money. You can build infrastructure, develop modern applications, gain insights from data, manage identity and access and more.

In this lab you will create a free trial Microsoft Azure account, and you will activate the benefits available to MSDN subscribers.

## Creating a trial Microsoft Azure Account

There are several ways to get an Azure subscription, such as the free trial subscription, the **pay-as-you-go** subscription, which has no minimums or commitments and you can cancel any time; **Enterprise agreement** subscriptions, or you can buy one from a Microsoft retailer. In this task you are going to create a free trial subscription.

1. Browse to the following page http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/free-trial/ to obtain a free trial account.
2. Click the **Try it Now** button.
3. Enter the credentials for the _Microsoft account_ that you want to use. You will be redirected to the **Sign up** page.

	> **Note:** Some of the following sections could be omitted in the Sign up process, if you recently verified your Microsoft account.

4. Enter your personal information in the **About you** section. If you have previously loaded this info in your Microsoft Account, it will be automatically populated.
